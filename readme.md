# Description #

Distributional semantics is one of the most important notions in contemporary computational linguistics and NLP: representations of meaning exploiting distributional semantics framework are used in almost any NLP system. Therefore, deep understanding of distributional semantics and models based on it is crucial for resolving cutting-edge NLP tasks. The main idea of this course is to give such understanding to the listener.

It is important to understand that this course is not about NLP and/or semantics in general. Many aspects crucial for a NLP (or semantics) course will be omitted, and this course is not recommended for a listener seeking for a good introductory NLP course. Instead, this course will give an exhaustive (and unique) introduction to a much more narrower NLP field called distributional semantics (in context of modern NLP techniques and linguistic theories).
